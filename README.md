Background
Recipe sharing platforms have been a staple in the culinary world, serving as both a classic way to share culinary creations and a foundation for learning cooking principles. Now that the team and the challenge are well defined, it is time to create a specification for the first version of the Flavour Fusion software. This is important because it is an opportunity to get the scope of the project right. If a project is too small in scope, it does not serve as an opportunity to expand your technical understanding or present as impressive. When a project is too large in scope, the project will likely be incomplete by the end of the development period.

Scope
For this project, consider that it is better to end up with something a bit smaller in scope that has undergone a couple (or at least one) iteration of deployment, testing, and bug fixes. Documentation is also a big bonus! In this project, I am expected to complete the Flavour Fusion MVP, which will be available on a public domain and on top of the ALX project.
